# EECS 2011Z - FINAL Q5


## `insert( )` method -

As mentioned in the slides and textbook, we know that the `insert( )` takes __`O(h)`__ time where `h = log(N)` _(the height of the tree)_  
The `insert( )` method consists of -

- Finding the initial location to insert: _`O(logN)`_ run time.  

- Restructuring up the tree, maintaining heights:  _`O(logN)`_ run time.

## Inserting `N` keys

As seen from above, inserting a single key takes `O(logN)` time.  
Therefore inserting `N` keys will take __`O(NlogN)`__ time. 

### The theta bound for inserting `N` keys is __`theta(NlogN)`__
