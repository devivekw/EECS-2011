## `insertLast( )` Run Time -

If the array is not full and `insertLast( )` is being called the run time is __`O(1)`__ this is because no new array has to be created and it just adds another element in the next available spot.  
Whereas when `insertLast( )` is being called, with a completely filled array it has to call the `buildQ( )` method. More about the method below.

## `buildQ( )` Run Time -

In a completely filled array, the array has to copy `N` elements from its current array to a new array of size `2N`. Assuming that creating an array takes `O(1)` time, it takes __`O(N)`__ to copy the elements from the current array to the new array.  

### The theta bound for the `buildQ( )` method is  __`theta(N)`__

The following is the insertLast( ) method from assignment 3.

```Java
public void insertLast(final int e) {
    if (size() + 1 == capacity) {
        // When the array is full.
        int[] tempArray = new int[2 * capacity];

        for (int i = 0; i <= rear; i++) //Run time of O(N)
            tempArray[i] = A[i];

        for (int i = capacity + front; i < tempArray.length; i++) //Run time of O(N)
            tempArray[i] = A[i - capacity];

        front = capacity + front;
        capacity *= 2;
        A = tempArray;
    }

    if (isEmpty()) {
        A[front] = e;
        rear = 1;
    } else {
        A[rear] = e;
        rear = (rear + capacity + 1) % capacity;
    }
}
```
